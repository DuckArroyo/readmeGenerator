## Installation

Duplicate the repository to your own machine or github account.
The application requires npm, fs, and Inquirer.js to work.

FS and Inquirer should be listed in the package-lock.json under the dependencies
Caveat, the Inquirer installation will download node_modules which is a large folder thus a gitinore is included in the files to prevent a github upload.

## Usage

Open use. This is a student project.
